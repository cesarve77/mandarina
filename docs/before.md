Mandarina is just the glue for the following libraries and frameworks:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)

- [Uniform](https://github.com/vazco/uniforms)

- [Antd](https://ant.design/)


Is a very good idea learn them in order to have a better understanding of mandarina.
